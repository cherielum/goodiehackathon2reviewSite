        <p>This weekend from Friday November 17 to Sunday November 19 me and a team of seven people helped build an app to create a Mentor/Mentee responsive site for kids in "broken" households so that kids may get great mentors and create a great future should they want it. I worked on the front end of things with another guy, and we made it clickable (at least on the front end). For the backend, a database was created on a local computer and images were able to uploaded as well as username/pw stored. This helped us see what the user was seeing and how you only see the Welcome Screen once (only when you sign in). Our one successfully unsuccessful function was for a chat box and it was not integrated but another teammate used sockets to have multiple users talk to each other on the local server. To learn more feel free to go to the founder's site <a href ="http://tribetalk.azurewebsites.net/">here!</a> Below is a brief slideshow of how the web app is seen on an iphone 6 phone and can be used. To read more about my experience feel free to read about it on my <a href = "https://atlgirlcoder.wordpress.com/2017/11/19/goodie-nation-hackathon-2/">blog.</a> </p>
